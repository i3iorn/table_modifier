# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We want this project to be a friendly, respectful, and safe space for anyone interested in contributing — now or in the future. While this project is currently small and may not have active contributors, we still value the principles of openness, kindness, and constructive collaboration.

## Guidelines

To keep things positive and productive:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Assume good intentions from others
- Offer constructive feedback, not criticism
- Avoid offensive or inappropriate language or behavior
- Keep discussions focused on improving the project

This applies to all public communication related to the project — whether in code, issues, pull requests, discussions, or elsewhere.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We ask that you avoid:

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment or exclusionary behavior
- Sharing others' private information
- Disruptive or intentionally unhelpful comments

If you're not sure if something is appropriate, err on the side of kindness and professionalism.

## Reporting Issues

If you see behavior that goes against this Code of Conduct, please let us know. You can contact the maintainer directly at **[conduct@schrammel.dev]**. Reports will be handled discreetly and respectfully.

## Changes

This Code of Conduct may be updated over time as the project evolves and the community grows. Feedback is always welcome.
